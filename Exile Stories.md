The flood
Genesis 7-9

There are two exile threads to see in this story, the first:

> 11 And the earth was corrupted before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth. ([Genesis 6:11–12](https://ref.ly/Ge6.11-12;leb), LEB)

The Eden exiles have fulfilled Yahweh’s command to subdue the earth but not as intended, they filled it with.

And the second, Noah and his family were placed in exile from the Earth where they were supposed to live and exist and forced to be amongst the chaos waters of un-creation
After the flood sub sided they were returned from exile to the 'new creation' of the cleansed world but as the vineyard story shows us it was not as it was supposed to be as all the same problems still existed. So they returned but it was not to the hoped for Eden complete redemptive hope.

On Noah and family's return from their exile in the chaos waters they are returned to the earth where everything is new and different - like a new creation for them, but they had not changed or been renewed so the same patterns began again straight away. This is the start of the return from exile but not everything is right and in fact in some ways they are still in exile after their return.
